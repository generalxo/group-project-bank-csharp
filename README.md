During the first week of the group project we were uncertain about how to approach the project.
Communication was also a factor to our uncertainty. Week 1 was not so much about the work, rather
more about planning and structure how we work. 
Some of the time we had we spent on research about agile methodologies and the manifesto. 
We were also getting to know eachother which was not a written step, but something rather important.
During the first week and a bit into the next, we were working together at all times. Which improved
our communication and trust in eachothers work. 

During week 2 we had established a good foundation to upon. At this point we started to work individually
with our individual task. We decided that we are going to plan a sprint during a meeting once a week. 
This worked great and put us all on the right path of our development of the Bank application.

Once week 3 started we had a meeting with our team coach where we established a new approach to improve our day of planning.
An analasys of the previous sprint (week) was to be had during our weekly meeting. During this analasys we bring up
the things that could be improved and also what was working great. 

Week 4 we continued with working the way had the previous week since it didn't need to be adjusted to any other way.
We prioriticed on polishing and creating consistency in our code and application. 

Now that we are ending our project we all agree that the time we had together had gone by very fast. 
Our top priority now is to finish the most important things which are required to complete the assignment.
